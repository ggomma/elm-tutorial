# Use boilerplate


1. install [`create-elm-app`](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app)
    ```bash
    > npm install -g create-elm-app
    ```
2. Create a new project
    ```bash
    > create-elm-app helloWorld

    Creating helloWorld project...

    Dependencies ready!         
    Success! Compiled 1 module.

    Project is successfully created in `/Users/ggomma/Dev/elm-tutorial/02_boilerplage/helloWorld`.

    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

        elm-app start
            Starts the development server.

        elm-app build
            Bundles the app into static files for production.

        elm-app test
            Starts the test runner.

        elm-app eject
            Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
            and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

        cd helloWorld
        elm-app start
    ```
3. Run app
    ```bash
    > cd helloWorld
    > elm-app start
    ```
